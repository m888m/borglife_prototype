# Borglife Non-Commercial License v1.0

## TL;DR (human-readable ;-D, not legally binding)

Think of this as the vibe check for the license — **the binding stuff is the legal text that follows**.

- **Engine is non-commercial.**  
  The Borglife Protocol (engine, code, models, etc.) is free to use for **non-commercial** stuff:
  - personal hacking, learning, research, side projects;
  - academic / non-profit research;
  - company-internal **non-production** testing, evaluation, and research (no customers touched, no money made).

- **No commercial / production use of the engine without a deal.**  
  You **cannot**:
  - deploy Borglife in production for paying users,
  - sell hosted Borglife as SaaS,
  - bundle the engine into a paid product,
  - fork Borglife for a commercial version,  
  **unless** you get a separate commercial license from the Borglife Team.

- **You can fork, tweak, and share — under the same NC constraints.**  
  You can:
  - modify the code,
  - fine-tune / customise,
  - share your forks and builds,  
  as long as:
  - it stays **non-commercial**, and
  - people receiving it get this same core license and at least the same restrictions on the Borglife bits.

- **Add-ons can be proprietary / commercial.**  
  If your code only talks to Borglife via its **documented APIs** and doesn’t include Borglife code:
  - it’s **not** considered a “Derivative” under this license; and
  - you can license and monetise that add-on however you want (your SDKs, dashboards, agents, etc.).

- **Outputs are yours (with some rules).**  
  Stuff generated by Borglife (genomes, metadata, etc.) is your responsibility:
  - You can use Outputs **commercially** (e.g. turn them into NFTs, products, art, services),  
    subject to:
    - whatever **Borg IP / royalty rules** the on-chain contracts define, and
    - the “don’t-do-evil / don’t-break-laws” restrictions in the license.
  - You **cannot** use Outputs to train or distill a model that’s basically a drop-in replacement for Borglife’s core capabilities.

- **Some things are just not allowed.**  
  You may not use the Protocol, Derivatives, or Outputs for:
  - military applications,
  - surveillance targeting people,
  - biometric identification / biometric profiling,
  - rights-infringing or obviously illegal use cases,
  - anything that violates applicable laws (GDPR, etc.).

- **No warranty.**  
  If Borglife breaks, misbehaves, or ruins your experiment:
  - there’s **no warranty**,
  - and the Borglife Team’s liability is extremely limited.

Again: this is just a summary. **Read the full license below if you’re doing anything serious.**

**Effective Date:** November 25, 2025  

Borglife Team (“**we**”, “**our**”, or “**Licensor**”) is pleased to make available the software, code, and protocols for the Borglife Protocol (as defined below) for your **Non-Commercial use (as defined below)**, which includes internal, non-production testing and research for commercial entities, as set forth in this Borglife Non-Commercial License (“**License**”).

The “**Borglife Protocol**” means the Borglife software platform, including but not limited to its algorithms, source code, inference code, evaluation code, fine-tuning code (if applicable), checkpoints, parameters, and any other materials associated with the Borglife system made available by Licensor under this License, including any technical documentation, manuals, and instructions for use and operation thereof (collectively, the “**Borglife Protocol**”).  

We may also make available certain elements included in this definition under a separate license (for example, specific code components), and nothing in this License will be deemed to restrict or limit any other licenses we grant in such elements.

By downloading, accessing, using, Distributing (as defined below), or creating a Derivative (as defined below) of the Borglife Protocol, you agree to the terms of this License. If you do not agree to this License, then you do not have any rights to access, use, Distribute, or create a Derivative of the Borglife Protocol and you must immediately cease using the Borglife Protocol. If you are agreeing to this License on behalf of your employer or another entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind that entity. If you do not have such authority, you may not accept the License or access the Borglife Protocol on behalf of that entity.

## 1. Definitions

a. **“Derivative”** means any (i) modified version of the Borglife Protocol (including but not limited to any customized or fine-tuned version thereof), (ii) work based on the Borglife Protocol, or (iii) any other derivative work thereof. For the avoidance of doubt:  

   - **Outputs** (as defined below) and **Borg IP** (as defined below) are **not** considered Derivatives under this License.  
   - Separate software, models, or services that merely interoperate with the Borglife Protocol solely through its documented interfaces, without incorporating Borglife Protocol code, are **not** considered Derivatives under this License.

b. **“Distribution”**, **“Distribute”**, or **“Distributing”** means providing or making available, by any means, a copy of the Borglife Protocol and/or any Derivatives.

c. **“Non-Commercial Purpose”** means any of the following uses, but only so far as **you do not receive any direct or indirect payment arising from the use of the Borglife Protocol or Derivatives**:

   i. Personal use by private individuals for research, experimentation, testing, personal study, private entertainment, hobby projects, or otherwise not connected to commercial activities;  
   ii. Use by research institutions, academic entities, or non-profit organizations for non-commercial research and development;  
   iii. Use by commercial or for-profit entities solely for **internal testing, evaluation, or non-commercial research in a non-production environment**;  
   iv. Use by charitable organizations for charitable purposes; and  
   v. Non-monetised public demos and open-access tools that **do not deliver or promote commercial services**, even if operated by for-profit entities.  

   For clarity, the following uses are **not** Non-Commercial Purposes:

   - (a) Use of the Borglife Protocol or Derivatives for revenue-generating activities, including paid services, subscriptions, or advertising-supported products;  
   - (b) Use in direct interactions with or impacting end users in a commercial context (including production deployment of products or services);  
   - (c) Use by companies for any commercial exploitation or forking of the Borglife Protocol or Derivatives for commercial use; or  
   - (d) Using the Borglife Protocol or Derivatives to train, fine-tune, or distill models for commercial purposes.

d. **“Outputs”** means any content or results generated by the operation of the Borglife Protocol or Derivatives from inputs provided by users, including but not limited to genome representations, metadata, logs, or other generated artifacts. For the avoidance of doubt, Outputs do **not** include any components of the Borglife Protocol itself, such as source code, model weights, parameters, or fine-tuned versions thereof.

e. **“Borg IP”** means the intellectual property embodied in Borgs evolved on or via the Borglife Protocol and represented as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or similar on-chain assets, including lineages, genetic traits, and associated royalties, as governed by separate smart contracts and agreements.

f. **“you”** or **“your”** means the individual or entity entering into this License with Licensor.

## 2. License Grant

a. **License.**  
Subject to your compliance with this License, Licensor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable, royalty-free, and limited license to:

- access and use the Borglife Protocol,  
- create Derivatives of the Borglife Protocol, and  
- Distribute the Borglife Protocol and such Derivatives,  

in each case **solely for your Non-Commercial Purposes**.

This License is personal to you. You may not assign or sublicense this License or any rights or obligations under it without Licensor’s prior written consent. Any attempted assignment or sublicense in violation of the foregoing will be void and will automatically and immediately terminate this License. Any restrictions set forth herein regarding the Borglife Protocol also apply to any Derivative you create or that is created on your behalf.

b. **Non-Commercial Use Only.**  
You may only access, use, Distribute, or create Derivatives of the Borglife Protocol for **Non-Commercial Purposes**.

- Private individuals and research institutions may use the Borglife Protocol freely under this License for Non-Commercial Purposes.  
- For-profit entities may use the Borglife Protocol **only** for Non-Commercial Purposes, such as internal, non-production testing, evaluation, or research, and are **strictly prohibited** from any commercial use, including production deployment, monetisation, or forking of the Borglife Protocol or Derivatives for commercial purposes.

If you wish to use the Borglife Protocol or a Derivative for any **commercial activity**, you must obtain a separate commercial license from Licensor, which may be granted or denied in Licensor’s sole discretion and may involve fees, royalties, or other conditions.

c. **Reserved Rights.**  
The grant of rights expressly set forth in this License constitutes the complete grant of rights to you in the Borglife Protocol. No other licenses are granted, whether by waiver, estoppel, implication, equity, or otherwise. Licensor reserves all rights in and to the Borglife Protocol not expressly granted by this License.

d. **Outputs.**  
Licensor does not claim ownership rights in and to the Outputs. You are solely responsible for the Outputs you generate and for your subsequent use of them.

You may use Outputs for **any purpose (including commercial)**, subject to:

- any applicable Borg IP rules (as described in Section 3), and  
- the prohibitions on certain high-risk, unlawful, or rights-infringing uses set out in **Section 5** of this License.

However, you **may not** use Outputs to train, fine-tune, or distill a model that is **substantially similar to or functionally substitutable for the Borglife Protocol’s core capabilities**, whether for commercial or non-commercial purposes.

## 3. Borg Ecosystem Exceptions

a. **Borg IP Not Governed by This License.**  
This License does **not** govern Borg IP. Rights in Borg IP, including the IP embodied in individual Borg NFTs, lineages, genetic traits, and associated royalties, are determined by the applicable smart contracts and by any separate agreements between the relevant creators and owners. To the extent Outputs embody Borg IP, rights in such Borg IP are governed by those smart contracts and agreements, not by this License.

b. **Mating and Royalties.**  
If Borgs mate or otherwise combine, any royalties, revenue sharing, or lineage-based allocations are determined and enforced by the applicable smart contracts or on-chain mechanisms, independently of this License.

c. **Independent Borgs.**  
There may exist independent Borgs or lineages that do not require sharing royalties, as determined by smart contracts or other on-chain or off-chain arrangements, independent of this License.

d. **Proprietary Add-ons.**  
Companies and individuals may build and offer proprietary or differently licensed software modules, models, or services that interface with the Borglife Protocol solely via documented interfaces (“protocol add-ons” or “Add-ons”). Such Add-ons are governed by their own licenses and do not alter the terms of this License for the core Borglife Protocol. For clarity, such Add-ons are not considered Derivatives under this License.

---

## 4. Distribution

Subject to your compliance with this License, you may Distribute copies of the Borglife Protocol and/or Derivatives that you create, under the following conditions:

a. **License Notice.**  
You must make a copy of this License available to all third-party recipients and specify that rights in the Borglife Protocol are granted directly by Licensor (Borglife Team), not by you.

b. **Attribution.**  
You must prominently display the following attribution notice in any distribution of the Borglife Protocol or Derivatives:

> “The Borglife Protocol is licensed by Borglife Team under the Borglife Non-Commercial License v1.0. © Borglife Team.”

c. **Derivatives.**  
If you Distribute any Derivative:

i. You must include a clear statement identifying the Derivative as a modified version of the Borglife Protocol and describing the nature of the modifications to the extent reasonably possible.  
ii. Your terms for the Derivative must not conflict with this License and must not expand the scope of rights in the Borglife Protocol beyond what is granted in this License.  
iii. You may not misrepresent any Derivatives as official Borglife products or imply endorsement by Licensor.

---

## 5. Restrictions

You will not, and will not permit any third party to:

a. **Commercial Use of Protocol.**  
Use, modify, or Distribute the Borglife Protocol or any Derivative for **commercial purposes** except as expressly authorized in a separate written commercial agreement with Licensor, or otherwise in violation of Section 2(b).

b. **High-Risk, Harmful, or Unlawful Uses.**  
Use the Borglife Protocol, any Derivative, or any Outputs for:

- military applications;  
- surveillance targeting individuals or groups;  
- biometric identification or biometric processing of individuals;  
- infringement of intellectual property rights, privacy rights, or other legal rights of any third party;
