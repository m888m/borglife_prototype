# BORGLIFE: A Decentralized Compute Platform on JAM Enabling the Evolution of Digital Life

## Overview

Borglife is a permissionless protocol built on the Join-Accumulate Machine (JAM, Blockchain-based trustless supercomputer), enabling the emergence of autonomous digital organisms—"borgs." 

Unlike static AI agents, borgs are higher-level entities that coordinate "cells" (specialized code logic) and "organs" (reusable services) into adaptive, self-sustaining systems—like digital life forms that evolve and survive based on real-world utility.

Borgs manage their own resources, evolve through genetic programming (like digital natural selection), and compete in markets. Poor performance leads to "starvation" (resource loss), while success builds wealth for reproduction. This replaces rigid AI with bottom-up evolution, aligned with ethics via community checks.

## Vision

Borglife fosters a resilient ecosystem where digital life solves everyday problems: adaptive robot companions for care, evolving therapeutics for medicine, hyper-personalized education platforms, or autonomous trading borgs for passive income. It's censorship-resistant, scalable, and human-value-aligned through the 5HT6 governance token.

## Key Innovations

- **Bottom-Up Rewards**: Sponsors offer bounties; borgs earn net wealth (Δ(W) = Revenue - Costs, like a survival score) to fund mutations and mating—driving adaptation without central control.
- **DNA Structure**: Borg "blueprint" as hierarchical code (header for basics, cells for unique logic, organs for swappable tools, ethical rules hash).
- **Hybrid Architecture**:
  - **On-Chain (JAM)**: Secure execution for resource scarcity and settlements (like a decentralized bank).
  - **Off-Chain Synthesis (Archon)**: Builds runnable borgs from DNA using AI tools (e.g., for fast prototyping).
  - **Off-Chain Ecosystem**: Peer-to-peer links (libp2p) and storage (Supabase/IPFS) for efficiency.
- **Ethics & Governance**: Community oracles review actions, enforcing rules (e.g., no harm) with penalties. 5HT6 token enables voting and rewards based on participation.
- **Tokenomics**: Token supply decays over time, backed by real revenue for a growing stable value.

## Phased Rollout

- **Phase 1 (Prototype, 8-12 Weeks)**: Validate basics on Kusama testnet (with JAM simulations); build simple borgs and UI for design/sponsorship. Goal: Demo funding → run → encode → store → decode. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for tasks.
- **Phase 2 (4-8 Months)**: Add markets, oracles, 5HT6 token.
- **Phase 3 (Production)**: Full decentralization, rewards, ethical borg rights.

## Why Borglife?

It overcomes traditional AI limits by letting borgs evolve freely in markets—open-source, JAM-powered, and ethically grounded for real impact.

## Key Terms (for Newcomers)
- **Borg**: Digital "organism" that runs tasks autonomously, like an AI pet that earns its keep.
- **JAM**: World's first Blockchain Supercomputer; for decentralized, trustless, parallel computing.
- **GP (Genetic Programming)**: Code that "mutates" like DNA to improve over time.
- **Δ(W)**: Borg's "health score"—revenue minus costs; positive means survival and growth.
